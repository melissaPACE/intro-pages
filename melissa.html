  <h3> Hello! My name is Melissa my pronouns are she/her. I graduated from Westchester Community College in 2019 with an AS in Cybersecurity. 
        This is my second semester here at Pace as an Information Technology major and Criminal Justice minor. At WCC, I lead and participated in several Cybersecurity clubs,
        and I also won and participated in several competitions like NCCDC, National Cyber League, and an Intercollegiate Cyber Forensics competition. Growing up, 
        I've always had a love for computers. I built my own computer by myself by just watching different youtube tutorials on how to do so.
        I like to spend my free time playing PC video games like League of Legends and World of Warcraft. I have three cats and I like to go outside ~ sometimes.
        </h3>
